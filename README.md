My project examines the relationship between lunar tides and hydrothermal vent fluid temperature at Axial Seamount. I used OOI data from a temperature resistivity probe in the throat of the Escargot vent, during what I interpret to be the end of its life. I looked fluid temperature fluctuations over the course of two randomly selected weeks: one before the sudden temperature drop (October), and one after (March).  These temperatures were compared with tides at shore and theoretical lunar tides using model created using the ephem library. The theoretical tides not only have the advantage of being more accurate to the location, they also isolate lunar tide specifically. The downside is that the model is overly simplistic. Even without the tide models, we can still compare the changes in temperature over time with what we would expect the pattern of high and low tides to look like. This project could be expanded by examining other variables that contribute to changes in fluid temperature, incorporating data from another nearby vent (there's one being monitored similarly in Canada), and by devoping a more advanced tide model.
